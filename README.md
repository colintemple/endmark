# Endmark

Endmark is a Wordpress plugin that adds an end-of-article symbol to the end of your posts and/or pagesâ€”just like in the magazines! This little bit of typography adds a slight professional edge to your blog.

I decided to make this plugin when I updated my blog's design and wanted one of these symbols at the end of my posts, but I couldn't find anything out there to do this.

The plugin allows you to use any symbol or image as your Endmark.

## Installation

1. Download the [dist/endmark.zip](https://github.com/colintemple/endmark/raw/master/dist/endmark.zip) file and unzip it.

2. Upload the `endmark` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory in your Wordpress folder.

3. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in Wordpress.

4. Go to Endmark under Appearance to choose your symbol or image.

## Notes

- You can choose to publish Endmarks on posts or pages only. (Version 1.1+)

- If you choose to use an image for your Endmark, an actual <img> element is added to the end of your article. The class 'endmark' is assigned to the image so you can style it with CSS if desired.

- If you choose to use a symbol, a single non-breaking space is added before your Endmark.

- Symbols are automatically encoded into HTML entities where necessary.

- French language localization is included with the plugin.

## To-do list

- If you publish posts across multiple pages, the Endmark will show at the end of each page. I need to update this to only show on the last page. Also, the Endmark shouldn't show on the front page when the complete post is not shown.

- The plugin currently adds an Endmark to the end of the last paragraph in your post. If your post already ends with an image, it probably looks a bit odd. Instead, the Endmark should be added to the last paragraph that ends in text. This will be added in a future version.
