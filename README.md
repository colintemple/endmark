Endmark
=======

Endmark is a Wordpress plugin that adds an end-of-article symbol to the end of your posts and/or pagesâ€”just like in the magazines! This little bit of typography adds a slight professional edge to your blog.

Endmark was originally created by [Colin Temple](http://colintemple.com/). More information is available [online here](http://colintemple.com/endmark/).
